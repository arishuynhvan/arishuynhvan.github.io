## What is 180 Days of DataScience?
Based on the Quora answer by Mr. Thia Kaixin about [becoming a datascientist without a PhD](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-data-scientist-without-a-PhD/answer/Thia-Kai-Xin), 
I have decided to follow his 66 mini-hell formula. However, the name is too daunting for a scaredy cat like me, I changed the title to feel more trendy & encouraging.

>Start with the 66 mini hell formula:

>From now on, spend 60 minutes every day on data science. Start with breadth topics MOOCs from Coursera, edX and other online resources. that covers basics of machine learning and statistics. Don't be embarrassed if you don't understand anything. Ask on Quora, ask on forums, find out more and keep going.
Do this for 6 months, non-stop every day. Then evaluate if all these machine learning stuff interests you.

This formula is solely for gauging interests in Data Science and not to official study it! Thus, this 180DaysOfDataScience Challenge is only a litmus test of determination.

## What did I learn today?

### MITx Python
Since Python is one of the most popular languages for data analysis & visualization projects, I have handpicked a super challenging introductory Python course to drill my coding skills.

Today, I work on Assignment 3 - .


### The Challenge


## How did I tackle this?
