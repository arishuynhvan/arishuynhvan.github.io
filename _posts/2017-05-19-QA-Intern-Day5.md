title: QA Internship Day 5 - Team Lunch & Cool Shots
---

### Progress

1. Finished basic automation for 1st test case of a new core feature of the ShopBack site... will have to keep reminding Vara to vet through my test plan again!!!!
2. Helped a bit with testing the new feature manually & registered **replicable** defects. The key is replicable, not random issues that could be caused by a slip of action or incomplete changes on the feature branch
3. Figured out the HTTP request for creating test users for any app logging in with FB accounts through Graph API, with app id, app secret.

### What's next?

1. MUST automate HTTP request communication using webdriverio or NodeJS with Graph API for
  1. FB test user creation
  2. retrieval of new test FB user's credentials
  3. transfer of such info to FB login test scripts (wdio)
  4. deletion of that new FB test user
2. MUST complete 14 test cases for FB login
3. Freaking finish the rest of the test suite without trial running them first (problem with some properties to be set in DB for test accounts). I really hate it man, could qa just get access to a secure API for manipulating DB ?????? Right now we have to keep asking dev to change info in DB for our test accounts

### Experience

1. Good time during team lunch though I felt kinda awkward for being unable to fit in girl's conversation on the latest trends in fashion, food & cosmetics (totally feel like unfeminine again ">.<). I couldn't quite talk to the guys either since they keep mentioning various common acquaintance with high achievements, who I'm so clueless about... 

```
Network - 0
Stomach - 1
```

2. Crazy time focusing on discussions on issues, felt like an idiot while making a dev re-explain the error to me after the discussion due to my lack of attention... Felt like everyone was focused while I was dripping off..., and worse off, got caught. Just rmb to focus better to avoid wasting peers' time!!!!! 

3. Supervisor was super helpful despite her super tight schedule and tons of responsibilities for the latest deployment. Felt like a nuissance for being unable to help her in any possible way. Got assigned with new or separate testing flows...

4. An intern is leaving after today, so he treated all new interns with good icecream, but I felt awkward for being unable to remember him/face/role before talking to other interns about him during the farewell. Feel like out of the place again.

To sum up, I feel kinda weird even after 1 whole week, and very inclined to curl up into my comfort shell again. Pray I can get the courage to freaking join and catch up with others... 

Well, this leaving intern is actually awesome... he gave me the encouragement in the form of a memorable card right when I needed (just after writing the previous line...)

I dunno how to respond. Just hope that his good wishes for me will come true. Or maybe I will try to maintain strength to make it come true :-?
