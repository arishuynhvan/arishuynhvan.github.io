title: Restart 100 Days of Code
---

## Motivation

So it's quite obvious that I gave up on the previous iteration of 100 days of code (which started in Jan 2017).
Yet, I don't want to give up this training, so I'll try again

## Structured programs to follow

30 days, 30 sites - [techwithtris]()

[30daysofjavascript]() - wesbos

[dailyUI]()

[freecodecamp]()

## Side projects

Charchawale for [makerwala.in](http://makerwala.in/)


## Day 1

### What I've achieved

- I revamped my [about page in codepen]() by following the [bootstrap tutorial on w3school for company]()
- I also set up my own free domain with .tech using my student (.edu) email. It's free for a year, so it's good enough for me to use now


### What's next?

- Update the form & buttons in my about page for collecting real email addresses & send clients' emails to me
- Update my website titles for this repo (new title: T.An Elegant Tech)
- Major revamp for the structure of this site
- Post my portfolio on FB (in the far future when my other sites of portfolio are more ready)

### Learning points

- "vw" (viewport width) units for scaling with page width
- Adding Google map to my site
- Splitting rows for responsive display of big & smal screen sizes
- How to set up free email with my free domain & direct it to my gmail account
- How to link my domain to Github pages
- How to get a [free .edu email]()

#### More on how to link my free .tech domain with Github pages
