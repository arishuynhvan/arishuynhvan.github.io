title: Jekyll Blog is up! Yay!
---
## What is the challenge today?
Set up the Jekyll blog  to plan for my projects during the #100DaysOfCode Challenge & document my learning points despite Windows as my OS system

## How did I tackle this?
I followed the instructions on [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and fork the [Jekyll Now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
Then I changed the _config.yml file, update the name of the forked repo, and set up the link to this blog with github pages.  
I also set up the ruby workspace on C9.io for this forked repo so I don't have to worry about my OS.

## Was it solved?
No, the blog post is now missing on the local site launched in c9.io :( 

## What did I learn?
[Cool sites powered by Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites)

## What else should I try next (or next time)?
I need to figure out why my blog post is missing when launched locally on c9.io and get it appear here.

Next I can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of mmy repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make my future posts is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update this markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

I also plan to get my personal domain, probably on namecheap with my free education pack and link it to my Jekyll blog instead of the free domain from github pages.

## What did I help others with today?
I didn't help anyone yet

## How do I think/feel about that?
A bit sad, but I hope to really help someone tomorrow
