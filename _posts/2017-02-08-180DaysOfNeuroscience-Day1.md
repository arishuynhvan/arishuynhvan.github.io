## What is 180 Days of Neuroscience (180DoN)?
Based on the Quora answer by Mr. Thia Kaixin about [becoming a datascientist without a PhD](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-data-scientist-without-a-PhD/answer/Thia-Kai-Xin), 
I have decided to apply his 66 mini-hell formula as described on [today's 180DoDS blog post](/180DaysOfDataScience-Day1/) to gauge my interest in Neuroscience. 

## What did I learn today?
### Bioelectricity
I've finished the tutorial of BN4402 Electrophysiology for this week today. It was really hard ...

### Frontiers in NeuroEngineering
I have rewatched the video from Prof X, Hebrews U, ... and noted down the key advances in neuroengineering
Today, I hope to write 2 reviews, one on the development history and the onther on latest updates on these 5 topics. So, I started with outlining & gathering refences for the history post first.

## What else should I try next (or next time)?
Connect the dots, visualize & present the history post engagingly.

## What was my community participation today?
The reviews will be shared with [NUS Neuro Interest Blog](https://nusneurointerest.wordpress.com/)

## How do I think/feel about that?
