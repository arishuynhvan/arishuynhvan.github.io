## What is 180 Days of Neuroscience (180DoN)?
Based on the Quora answer by Mr. Thia Kaixin about [becoming a datascientist without a PhD](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-data-scientist-without-a-PhD/answer/Thia-Kai-Xin), 
I have decided to apply his 66 mini-hell formula as described on [today's 180DoDS blog post](/180DaysOfDataScience-Day1/) to gauge my interest in Neuroscience. 

## What did I learn today?


## What else should I try next (or next time)?


## What was my community participation today?


## How do I think/feel about that?
