## Restart 100 Days of Code
What a shame that I have stopped my quest in coding for a month!
Nevertheless, I will restart my coding journey again today. Probably define proper goals & projects will help boost my motivation

## Goals
### Personal Brand
It's essential to establish a personal brand. I have a lot of ideas floating around in my mind, but currently find it hard to
incorporate them into a unified theme for my site design

Things I really want to have in my brand:

- Personal blog featuring my learning journey, with subscription option
- Personal newsletter
- Design projects
- Mobile-first, responsive, accesible web-app
- Mobile cross-platform native apps

Thus, I've come up with a few project lists:

    - Algorithm solutions

    - Software engineering practices & experience
    - Startup ideas
    - Entrepreneurship journey (focus: social enterprise)
