## Restart 100 Days of Code
What a shame that I have stopped my quest in coding for a month!
Nevertheless, I will restart my coding journey again today. Probably define proper goals & projects will help boost my motivation.

Also, I will adopt the scrum project management & arrange my goals into sprints.
Each project will have a separate backlog on its github repository.
Every day, the standup time will be 15 minutes for writing the log & posts for learning content


## Goals
### Personal Brand
It's essential to establish a personal brand. I have a lot of ideas floating around in my mind, but currently find it hard to
incorporate them into a unified theme for my site design

Things I really want to have in my brand:

- Personal blog featuring my learning journey, with subscription option
- Personal newsletter
- Design projects
- Mobile-first, responsive, accesible web-app
- Mobile cross-platform native apps

Thus, I've come up with a few project lists:

#### Portforlio

    - Algorithm solutions
    - Front-end learning journey
    - Android app development trainings
    - User experience & graphical design practices
    - Data science self-study

    - Language learning journey (English, French, German, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Korean)
    - Software engineering practices & experience
    - Startup ideas
    - Entrepreneurship journey (focus: social enterprise)

After all this planning, here's an update on today's coding progress
## Day 3
So I took some time to venture in more dangerous zones of git. Firstly, I restarted my blog workspace in c9.io and realized I have changed my entire repo without upating it.
This error: `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` showed up.Thus, I started with `git pull ----allow-unrelated-histories` [Source: StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories)
