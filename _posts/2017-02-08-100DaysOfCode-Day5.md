## Today's achievements

### Shell script to automate Jekyll Now blog post
[Reference](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_wss0010.php)

### Clean up blog Description
Move my descriptions from `_config.yml` (where it is treated as value to the variable `site.descriptions`) to `default.html` file

### Android Screen Flow Tutorial
I've finished writing the blog post on the [basic of screen flow for a todo app](/ScreenFlow-Simple-TodoApp/) 

### Wakatime Tracking in c9.io
The problem was mostly solved with the manual approach in [yesterday blog](/100DaysOfCode-Day4/), but the time is not tracked properly,
unless I work in debug mode (`?debug=2` is appended to the end of the workspace url)

## What did I learn?

## What else should I try next (or next time)?

## What did I help others with today?

## How do I think/feel about that?
