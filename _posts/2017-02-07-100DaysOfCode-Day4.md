## What did I code today?

### Portforlio
Build a Resume for About Page with JSON Resume

### Study

#### CS2103

#### MITx Python
Assignment 3 - . More details in the post [180DaysOfDataScience - Day 1]()


#### Data Science - General Assembly
Learning X & Y with Z instructors. More details in the post [180DaysOfDataScience - Day 1]()

### The Challenge
JSON Resume has certain fixed theme when published in HTML, so I need to modify its design manually to suit my needs.
From HTML to PDF still requires some further steps since I need the customization.

#### Minor Issue
As I have started to use WakaTime to track my coding time & understand my pratice patterns for various languages & disciplines, I attempted to install the plugin for C9.io
However, it was an [unsolved bug]() for some time, regarding connecting C9.io to wakatime. I'm really intersted to solve this bug, 
so intend to head over to the wakatie community and hopefully figure it out.

## How did I tackle this?


## Was it solved?


## What did I learn?


## What else should I try next (or next time)?


## What did I help others with today?


## How do I think/feel about that?
