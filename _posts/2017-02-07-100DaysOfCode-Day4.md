## What did I code today?

### Portforlio
Build a Resume for About Page with JSON Resume

### Study

### The Challenge
JSON Resume has certain fixed theme when published in HTML, so I need to modify its design manually to suit my needs. 
From HTML to PDF still requires some further steps since I need the customization.

#### Minor Issue

As I have started to use WakaTime to track my coding time & understand my pratice patterns for various languages & disciplines, 
I attempted to install the plugin for C9.io However, it was an [unsolved bug](https://github.com/wakatime/c9-wakatime/issues/2) for some time, regarding connecting C9.io to wakatime. Iâ€™m really intersted to solve this bug, so intend to head over to the wakatie community and hopefully figure it out.

## How did I tackle this?
For JSON Resume, I followed the manual installation instructions in the [JSONResume/resume-cli repo](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli).
Then, I changed the JSON data with my particulars, and export it as the html. The html still seems a bit daunting to customize for now, but I should be ok working with it.

For the wakatime installation in c9.io, I've followed @alanhamlett's [manual instruction](https://github.com/wakatime/c9-wakatime/issues/8#issuecomment-276174682).

## Was it solved?
Both the challenge & issues are basically solved.

## What did I learn?
Not much today actually, just some simple settings & json manipulation

## What else should I try next (or next time)?
Finish up my JSON Resume design customization

## What did I help others with today?
Nothing again :(

## How do I think/feel about that?
Sad
