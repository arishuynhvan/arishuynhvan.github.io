title: A Personal Attempt at Entrepreneurship
---
## Context
I've applied and enrolled myself in [Idea$]() 2017 competition organized by EDIC NUS. 
Having come up with an idea for a web app from a personal pain point as a foreign student, I decided to develop a product to solve that problem.
As the competition aims to get students launch their own startups eventually, I saw no reason for not pushing my idea further for a future startup.

There is one big obstacle though, I haven't found any other souls to form a team for this idea. Litterally, the idea interests me beyond
the competition, so I don't care even if my teammates are not from NUS. In fact, a fit for interests, ethics and skills is the most important 
criteria for my future teammate.

Then I came across [EDGE Singapore](http://edgesociety.org/), the National Youth Entrepreneurship Community with a good track record of 
helping a batch of other student entrepreneurs launch their startups. So, I was applying to their next batch, instead of depending solely 
on Idea$, which is a brand new program.

While filling in its application form, I noticed that I didn't have a name for my startup, which is natural, because I haven't even
done a single bit of market validation. Still, it doesn't hurt to give it a try, so I went to google "startup naming guide", and came across
a few awesome articles.

Below are these resources and my insights after following them through
